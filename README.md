# ToDos

A simple yet functional task management app where you can add, store, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Originally created as a practice project, this ToDo app evolved into a fully developed portfolio piece, showcasing my skills in React, TypeScript, and state management.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks with a description.
- **Mark as Complete**: Keep track of completed tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks once completed or no longer needed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile use.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: For fast development build.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and enhances code readability.
- **React**: Core framework for building the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for efficient styling.
- **ShadCN UI**: Component library for consistent design.
- **React Redux**: For state management.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplified approach to managing state and side effects.
- **React Router**: Enables smooth navigation across different pages.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency.

## Challenges and Solutions

### State Management
The main challenge was managing the state of the tasks effectively. While I initially considered using the Context API, I ultimately implemented Redux for more scalable state management, making the app’s data flow easier to handle.

### Responsiveness
Creating a responsive UI was another challenge. I used Tailwind CSS for its utility classes and ShadCN UI for a unified component design, which helped in achieving a clean and responsive interface.

## Installation and Setup

**1.** Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jabirstain3/My-Todo.git
   ```

**2.** Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
    cd todo-app
  ```
**3.** Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
    npm install
  ```
**4.** Start the development server:
  ```bash
    npm run dev
  ```
